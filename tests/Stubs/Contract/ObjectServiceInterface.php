/**
 * TEST STUB — a VERBATIM copy of openregister's
 * `lib/Contract/ObjectServiceInterface.php`.
 *
 * 🔴 Copied rather than hand-mirrored, deliberately. The interface publishes 26
 * methods with multi-line signatures; a hand-written subset would let an
 * incompatible implementation pass locally and fail only in CI — the exact
 * asymmetry this file exists to remove. A stub narrower than the real type is
 * worse than no stub at all.
 *
 * It is needed because dossiq's tests `createMock()` this interface while
 * nothing declared it: CI clones `ConductionNL/openregister` (the
 * `additional-apps` workflow input) so the real one is on the autoloader there,
 * but a dev instance has no such clone and 40 tests died with
 * `Class or interface ... does not exist` — tests CI reported green.
 *
 * ⚠️ Keep in sync with openregister. When both are loadable the real one wins
 * (whichever autoloader resolves first), so drift shows up as a signature
 * mismatch rather than as this file being ignored.

/**
 * OpenRegister's object store, as a consuming app sees it (ADR-022, ADR-083).
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * A leaf app cannot mock what it cannot load. OpenRegister's concrete classes
 * are absent from a leaf app's standalone composer test environment, so every
 * consuming app either reaches through an untyped `ContainerInterface` --
 * hiding the dependency from readers and tooling alike -- or hand-rolls a
 * double.
 *
 * The doubles are not a hypothetical cost. Measured 2026-08-14, TEN of the
 * sixteen consuming apps already ship one:
 *
 *     opencatalogi 13   docudesk 12   openbuild 12   openconnector 10
 *     hermiq        8   pipelinq  7
 *     softwarecatalog, zaakafhandelapp, scholiq, decidesk: 0
 *
 * Against a real class of 88 methods. Their UNION is 23 -- ten files, ten
 * maintainers, and between them barely a quarter of the surface. The four
 * declaring zero methods are empty shells: they satisfy a type-hint and
 * nothing else, so any call through them is unchecked by construction.
 *
 * That is what this interface replaces: one definition, owned by the app that
 * implements it, which cannot drift from the implementation without PHP
 * refusing to declare the class.
 *
 * ## Scope is measured, not guessed
 *
 * The first draft of this file carried the eight most-called methods. Counted
 * per CALL that looked convincing; counted per CLASS it was not, because a
 * class can only type-hint the interface if EVERY method it calls is on it:
 *
 *     8 methods  ->  587 of 1001 consumer classes ( 58%)
 *
 * 414 classes -- the apps that would have had to keep their container hop --
 * were invisible in the per-call ranking. Re-measured per class, resolving the
 * receiver to OpenRegister's `ObjectService` (two apps ship a local class of
 * the same name, which the first count silently folded in):
 *
 *     829 consumer classes call 28 distinct methods.
 *
 * This interface declared 25 of them, covering 819 of the 829 classes (98.8%).
 * `patchObject()` was added afterwards and is the 26th. It is NOT part of that
 * measurement — no consumer called it, because it was not reachable through
 * this contract. It is published because `updateObject()` REPLACES, so a
 * consumer holding a partial payload had no correct method to call and either
 * hand-rolled read-merge-write or silently erased the fields it omitted.
 * The four it omits are omitted for a reason, and the ten classes they hold
 * back are listed rather than left to be discovered:
 *
 *     renderEntity()     takes a concrete `ObjectEntity`. An interface
 *                        parameter of `ObjectEntityInterface` would be WIDER
 *                        than the implementation accepts, which PHP rejects.
 *                        Widening the implementation instead is a real change
 *                        with real risk, so it is a separate decision.
 *                        Blocks 5: opencatalogi PublicationsController,
 *                        openconnector SynchronizationService, zaakafhandelapp
 *                        ZGWZaak{Lifecycle,Validation}Service and ZGWLogicService.
 *     getMapper()        returns ObjectServiceMapperAdapter -- an OpenRegister
 *                        type. It is an escape hatch that leaks the
 *                        implementation whatever we do here. Blocks 3:
 *                        openconnector EndpointService, LtiNrpsService,
 *                        PdokConnector.
 *     getOpenRegisters() is not ours. It is declared on zaakafhandelapp's OWN
 *                        `ObjectService` -- a locator returning this service.
 *                        Two apps ship a local class of that name, which is
 *                        why receiver resolution matters here. Blocks 3
 *                        openconnector classes, all of which mean their own.
 *     getLockInfo()      is not a method of ObjectService at all; it lives on
 *                        LockHandler. openbuild's VersionPromotionService
 *                        calls it on an ObjectService-typed property and
 *                        suppressed the resulting PHPStan `method.notFound`.
 *                        Wrapped in `catch (Throwable)`, so it has been
 *                        silently returning null rather than locking. Blocks 1,
 *                        and wants fixing on its own terms.
 *
 * ## Types
 *
 * Parameters are narrowed to what a consumer can express -- identifiers, not
 * OpenRegister entities. PHP's parameter contravariance lets the
 * implementation go on accepting `Register|Schema` objects as well, so nothing
 * inside OpenRegister changes.
 *
 * Returns are the entity INTERFACE, satisfied covariantly by the concrete
 * `ObjectEntity`.
 *
 * `saveObject()` takes `array`, not `array|ObjectEntityInterface`. The
 * implementation accepts `array|ObjectEntity`, and `array|ObjectEntity` is
 * NARROWER than `array|ObjectEntityInterface` -- so declaring the union here
 * makes OpenRegister's own class illegal. A compatibility probe caught that
 * before this shipped.
 *
 * ## RBAC
 *
 * `$_rbac` and `$_multitenancy` are part of the contract, not an
 * implementation detail. ADR-022 makes OpenRegister the authorisation boundary
 * for object access; a consumer passing `_rbac: false` is declaring that
 * OpenRegister is NOT authorising the call, and gate-7 reads it that way.
 *
 * ## Changing this file
 *
 * Widening the contract is a deliberate act and should follow a measurement,
 * not a convenience. Narrowing it is a BC break for every consuming app.
 *
 * ## Suppressions
 *
 * The same three PHPMD rules `ObjectService` itself already suppresses, for the
 * same reasons, because THIS FILE CANNOT DIFFER FROM THE SIGNATURES IT
 * DESCRIBES. Splitting `saveObject()` into flag-free methods here would simply
 * make the interface no longer implementable.
 *
 * `$_rbac` and `$_multitenancy` in particular are not incidental flags: ADR-022
 * makes them the authorisation boundary, and gate-7 reads `_rbac: false` as a
 * consumer declaring it has taken that responsibility on. They belong in the
 * contract precisely because they are load-bearing.
 *
 * @SuppressWarnings(PHPMD.BooleanArgumentFlag)   RBAC and multitenancy flags — see above.
 * @SuppressWarnings(PHPMD.ExcessiveParameterList) Mirrors ObjectService::saveObject().
 * @SuppressWarnings(PHPMD.ExcessivePublicCount)  26 methods, measured — see Scope above.
